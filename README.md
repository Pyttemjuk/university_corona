Group assignment with two others where I was responsible for the design on pages other than index.html and coronavirus.html. I was also responsible for all content on aktiviteter.html and online-moten.html. It is fairly obvious that we had some different opinions on the design of the site and, sad to say, the communication kind of broke down in the end. The project was done remotely over zoom and communications issues were partly due to difference in sound qualities for the meeting participants. I was unable to hear one of them so his input was lost to me and the other participant seemed to have a completely different view on what was decided during the meetings. It was certainly an experience and a firm lesson in the importance of clear communication.
